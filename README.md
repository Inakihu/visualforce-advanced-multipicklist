Advanced Multipicklist is a free, open-source Force.com library, that provides users and developers a other form to see and work with multipicklist fields. 
This component can be used as an advanced, highly configurable (by developer and user) replacement of <apex:selectOption> and fields into Standard Page Layouts.
